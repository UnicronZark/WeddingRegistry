# WeddingRegistry
My attempt at making a wedding registry website

Laying out my thoughts. I plan to have it hosted through google firebase, with react helping me on the front end. I am hoping to use somesort of database where you can save what you purchased and save who purchased it. There will most likely be links to other webpages, and using some sort of scraper i would like to have the prices of items on the wedding registry as well. This is the first thing I have attempted to create since college and I fear it is abovemy skill level. only one way to find out.
